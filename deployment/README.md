# Deployment Setup

This folder contains everything you need to set up self-hosted Git (Gitea) and automatic deployment for your Whisper application.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Setup (Gitea on this machine)

```bash
cd deployment
chmod +x quick-start.sh
./quick-start.sh
```

The interactive wizard will guide you through:
- Setting up Gitea (self-hosted Git server)
- Configuring webhook-based deployment
- Setting up Git remote

### Remote Setup (Gitea on remote server)

```bash
cd deployment
chmod +x remote-setup.sh
./remote-setup.sh
```

This will deploy Gitea to your remote server via SSH. See [REMOTE-SETUP.md](REMOTE-SETUP.md) for details.

### Manual Setup

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## üéØ What You'll Get

1. **Gitea** - Your own private Git server with web UI
   - Access at: `http://your-server:3000`
   - Git operations via HTTP or SSH
   - Built-in CI/CD with Gitea Actions

2. **Automatic Deployment** - Push code and it deploys automatically
   - Push to main branch ‚Üí triggers webhook ‚Üí deploys to Docker host
   - Includes rollback capability
   - Automated backups

## üîê Security Notes

Before going to production:
1. Change default passwords in docker-compose files
2. Use strong webhook secret (generated automatically)
3. Set up HTTPS with reverse proxy
4. Configure firewall rules

## üÜò Need Help?

1. Check [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) troubleshooting section
2. Verify services are running: `docker compose ps`
3. Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`

## üîÑ Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes
vim web_app.py

# 2. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"

# 3. Push to Gitea (triggers auto-deployment)
git push origin main

# 4. Check deployment
# Webhook automatically deploys to your Docker host
```

That's it! üéâ
